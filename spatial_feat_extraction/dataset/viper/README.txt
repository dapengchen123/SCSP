VIPeR:
Viewpoint Invariant Pedestrian Recognition Dataset

Released by the Computer Vision lab (vision.soe.ucsc.edu) at the University of 
California, Santa Cruz (www.ucsc.edu) on 9/22/07.  Please direct questions,
comments or other feedback to Doug Gray (dgray@soe.ucsc.edu).

********************************************************************************

This dataset contains 632 pedestrian image pairs.  Each pair contains two 
images of the same individual seen from different viewpoints.  Each image pair
was taken from an arbitrary viewpoint under varying illumination conditions.  
The data were collected in an academic setting over the course of several 
months.  Each image has been scaled to be 128x48 pixels.

reacquisition or tracking, please read (and cite) the following paper:
